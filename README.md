# CourseProject

This project was created during the angular course that I took.
There are two main sections in this project as represented by the two branches: the first contains the classic approach of building angular web applications and the second one an approach using state management with NgRx.
In summary, here are all the things that I learned from this course: 
  - using routing to display and load components based on a specific structure
  - attaching data to routes
  - cross components communication through services
  - creating and linking interceptors to http requests
  - implementing authentication logic
  - creating authguard services to protect routes
  - grouping components into modules for faster loading times
  - lazy loading modules for smoother user experience
  - implementing state management through NgRx store, actions, reducers and effects
